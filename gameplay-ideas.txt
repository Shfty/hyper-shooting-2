HS2 gameplay ideas
==================

- Parrying buckler
    - When active, all damage is done directly to armor
    - If armor runs out during use, guard break
        - Lose a chunk of health?
        - Momentary stun?
    - Parry mechanic
        - Spend little (or no) armor if timed perfectly
        - Open up enemy for heavy counter on parrying melee
        - Pile bunker built into buckler
    - Beam counter
        - Activate a high-powered beam counter if you use 100 armor in one go?
